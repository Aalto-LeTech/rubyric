    Rubyric is an online tool that allows you to receive submissions, create <strong>assessment rubrics</strong> and <strong>annotate submissions</strong> with feedback.
    Rubrics make it easy to give comprehensive feedback to students by allowing you to reuse commonly occurring feedback phrases.
    However, the phrases can be freely edited in order to give fully <strong>personalized feedback</strong> for each student.
